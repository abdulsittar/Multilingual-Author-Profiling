Sir whats the date for the first semi final, tonight or tomorrow night?

Score sir?

Unbelievable :-)
 
Unbelievable humiliation sir ;)

:-), so its Europe vs South America sir.

Agreed sir, especially after their semifinal display. However, it wouldn't be that easy for them in the final.

Supporting & Predicting Brazil :-) 

Semifinals aftershocks still continued for the Brazilians:-)
 
Yes sir, nice prediction. However, I wish it wouldn't get right for yesterday ;)

No doubt sir. I hope you would agree that Argentina was having an upper hand in terms of the chances and tight defense. In my opinion, Germany was quite lucky to survive atleast a 1-0 lead.

It wasn't that flawless Germany as it was against Brazil. However, luck has favoured both to some extent.

A frustrating miss sir :-)
 
This seems to be the Germany which I am afraid off sir :-)
  
Germany's consistency atlast paid off. However, it wasn't 3-0 sir. Anyways, congratulations from my side :-) 

:-) , Argentina didn't made.this 

:-) , Argentina didn't made this easier for them but ruined some golden chances which made the difference as well.

ASALAMUALAIKUM sir, kindly email me the scanned copy of your passport size picture with white background. Kind Regards, 

ASALAMUALAIKUM sir, where?

Sir we are in the university, any possibility for a meeting?

Sir are you free?

We are coming.

Things are developing rapidly and dramatically. I hope we would get rid off this corrupt democracy as an independence gift. :-)
 
WALAIKUMASALAM sir, its postponed till next week now :-) . Still can't believe it's the management of CIIT.

Good idea :-)
 
As highly expected, IK has partially withdrawn, now the ball is in Qadri's court as all eyes on him.

Agreed sir, but TUQ has so far excelled I'm gathering and managing an organized crowd. Therefore, it all depends upon the stance of TUQ after the deadline.

WALAIKUMASALAM, JAZAKALLAH sir, I'll have a look at it.

Sir where?

Hopefully sir. This time he has made an open attack on Army's dignity by betraying them yet again.

Drop scene sir? Or do you still expect our Army to come now?

Sir there is no class .

Sir I missed the match but just saw the scoreline and it was a bit surprising for me :-)
 
Yes sir. What's your prediction for the next semifinal?

Yes sir. Another disappointing end to an encouraging campaign.

Where ?

We are in solar cafe sir.

We are in soka cafe sir.

Sir I am in LB304.

Sir me at old cafe.

That's disappointing sir.

Yes sir.

We are in the cafe sir.

That's disappointing. If its a fitness issue than that's surprising as he rarely face this sort of issues.

That's quite unfortunate as we missed a definite cracking final.

It sounds to be an exhibition match and wouldn't have any effect on the final result.

Its live now :-)
 
ASALAMUALAIKUM sir, hope you have got the update regarding the quarterfinal between Pak and Ned.

I just checked over internet as well and got this surprisingly great update sir :-)
 
Australia won :-)
 
Sir kindly confirm your availaibility for tonight?

means doubtful.

Pakistan won :-)
 
3-4, winner in the last 1 and a half minute :-) 

Sir are you free in the evening?

As you wish sir, I am available.

He's absent today.

Sir, kindly join me here in the university and we'll decide than.
