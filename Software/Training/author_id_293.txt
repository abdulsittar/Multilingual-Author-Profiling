Eid greetings

I am good alhamdulillah. Hows days are going ?

What are you doing now a day? I mean what are your activities in summer vacations

Thats great i am glad to hear about your internship :) do focus on yourself rather than others. Let them speak and dont pay attention

Remember one thing.... I am nothing, you are nothing. Its Allah who let people meet, share and advise. 
So thanks to Almighty Allah :)

Remember
Allah helps those who help themselves. 
Do you remember that quote?
And also remember
When we help ourselves, we also become able to help others. And we should always help others.
As Allah love those who help others
