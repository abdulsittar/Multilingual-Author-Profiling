You know I don't know much about iOS

You should learn to backup your contacts to Google or Outlook

Dude why you keep losing your contacts? 

Shayad settings mein koi backup ka chakkar chalana paray ga
Mainay kabhi iOS sahi tarha use hi nahin kiya
Kaisay bataon?

baji,

I have removed some unwanted software on your laptop
I have also turned off many unwanted software at Windows Startup, you can launch them whenever you want
I have also hidden some apps from Start screen to load Windows quickly

If there is anything else you want to be removed or added please tell me

Bakwaas karnay ko kaha hai kisi ne?

Tu ne kaha ke light gai hoi hai

Rehne do
Phir kisi din ;-)  

Because Mainay abhi kiya hai
Lolx
